        <h2 id="text">About the Developer</h2>
        <h5 id="text">My name is Gian Anton V. Laguyo and I am currently 19 years old. I live in Bacolod City since the day i was born and now I am currently studying at University of Negros Occidental - Recoletos as a First year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am fond of watching lots of movies especially in my free time. I also like to binge watch anime series for it helps me relax whenever I feel stressed or bored. I am also planning to add anime in my website in the near future because I would like to share to other people what anime series I like to watch and also recommend some to those who want to watch anime.</h5>

        <h5 id="text">I also like to travel out of town. Although I have reached few places out of town, I still treasure them as my best experiences of travelling out of town with my family. Last year, we went to Don Salvador Benedicto and visited the refreshing pine trees beside the street. The air was so clean and the surroundings was all green. I would like to visit Don Salvador Benedicto again this summer.</h5>

        <h5 id="text">I went to Dumaguete last year and it was a blast! It was my first time to visit Dumaguete and Dumaguete did not fail to please me. The City was very clean and also the scenery was quite new to me and travelling there was very fun even though it took us almost 4 hours to reach Dumaguete by car. We also visited the famous Dumaguete boulevard and even saw Siliman University, the oldest university in Dumaguete.</h5>
